# aws-study-notes
A place to organize my notes on everything AWS

## Overview

Over the next several weeks or months, depending on how deep I get into the rabbit hole of AWS certifications, I intend to use this as a place to store my notes about the various services and features provided on the AWS platform. 

This is primarily for my own use/benefit, but if anyone else should find this information helpful, feel free to use it.

## Organization
Anyone interested will find the material organized by topic and contained within Jupyter Notebooks.
